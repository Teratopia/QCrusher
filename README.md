# QCrusher

QCrusher is a site dedicated to creating and solving quizzes. It was developed using java,
sql, html, and bootstrap. To take a quiz simply select one from the drop down menu on the
welcome page. Sign up and log in to create and edit quizzes, delete questions, and view
personal statistics. This online database driven CRUD project was completed in ten days
by myself and another student at SkillDistillery coding bootcamp.
